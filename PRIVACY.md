# Privacy Policy — Jadwaly (جدولي)

**Last updated:** February 13, 2026

## Overview

Jadwaly is a Chrome extension that helps university students build their class schedules. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the extension accesses and how it is handled.

## Data Collection

**Jadwaly does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

## Data Access

The extension accesses the following data **locally in your browser only**:

- **Course data from university portals:** The extension reads offered course information (course names, section numbers, times, and locations) from supported university student portals (Qassim University and Umm Al-Qura University). This data is used solely to display courses in the timetable builder and is never sent to any external server.

- **Local preferences:** User settings (such as dark mode, font sizes, and table configuration) are saved locally using Chrome's Storage API. This data never leaves your device.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, transfer, or share any user data with third parties.

## Third-Party Services

Jadwaly does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Remote Code

Jadwaly does **not** use any remotely hosted code. All JavaScript and CSS files are bundled locally within the extension.

## Permissions

| Permission | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| `tabs` | To check if the active tab is on a supported university portal and to prevent opening duplicate editor tabs. |
| `activeTab` | To access the current tab's content when the user interacts with the extension. |
| `storage` | To save user preferences locally on the device. |
| Host permissions | Content scripts run only on supported university portals to extract course data. |
